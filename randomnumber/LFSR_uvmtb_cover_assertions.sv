1. Cover all possible output values:
```verilog
cover property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (rng_out inside {[0:255]}))
  else $error("Cover: All output values are not covered.");
```

2. Cover all adjacent output value transitions (considering only 4-bit for simplicity):
```verilog
cover property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (rng_out_prev[3:0] + 1 == rng_out[3:0]))
  else $error("Cover: All adjacent 4-bit output value transitions are not covered.");
```

3. Cover all possible output value transitions (considering only 4-bit for simplicity):
```verilog
cover property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (rng_out_prev[3:0] !== rng_out[3:0]))
  else $error("Cover: All possible 4-bit output value transitions are not covered.");
```

4. Cover maximum and minimum output values:
```verilog
cover property (@(posedge clk) disable iff (reset) (rng_out == 8'h00 || rng_out == 8'hFF))
  else $error("Cover: Maximum and minimum output values are not covered.");
