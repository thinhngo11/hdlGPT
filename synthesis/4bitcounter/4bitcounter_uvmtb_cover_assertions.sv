1. Reset cover assertion: Cover the case when the counter is reset.

```systemverilog
property p_reset_cover;
    @(posedge clk) reset;
endproperty

cover_reset: cover property (p_reset_cover);
```

2. Load cover assertion: Cover the case when the counter is loaded.

```systemverilog
property p_load_cover;
    @(posedge clk) load;
endproperty

cover_load: cover property (p_load_cover);
```

3. Up counter cover assertion: Cover the case when the counter is counting up.

```systemverilog
property p_up_counter_cover;
    @(posedge clk) up_down && !load && !reset;
endproperty

cover_up_counter: cover property (p_up_counter_cover);
```

4. Down counter cover assertion: Cover the case when the counter is counting down.

```systemverilog
property p_down_counter_cover;
    @(posedge clk) !up_down && !load && !reset;
endproperty

cover_down_counter: cover property (p_down_counter_cover);
```

Add these cover assertions to the interface or top module of the testbench:

```systemverilog
interface loadable_up_down_counter_if(input wire clk);
    logic reset;
    logic load;
    logic up_down;
    logic [3:0] load_data;
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Add cover assertions here
    cover_reset: ...
    cover_load: ...
    cover_up_counter: ...
    cover_down_counter: ...
endinterface
