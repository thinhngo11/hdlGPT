1. Reset assertion: The counter value should be 0 after reset.

```systemverilog
property p_reset_assertion;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!reset) reset |-> count == 4'b0000;
endproperty

a_reset_assertion: assert property (p_reset_assertion) else $error("Reset assertion failed!");
```

2. Load assertion: The counter value should be equal to `load_data` after loading.

```systemverilog
property p_load_assertion;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!reset) load |-> count == load_data;
endproperty

a_load_assertion: assert property (p_load_assertion) else $error("Load assertion failed!");
```

3. Up counter assertion: The counter value should increment by 1 when counting up, and should not overflow.

```systemverilog
property p_up_counter_assertion;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!reset || load) (up_down && !load && !reset) |-> (count == $past(count) + 1);
endproperty

a_up_counter_assertion: assert property (p_up_counter_assertion) else $error("Up counter assertion failed!");
```

4. Down counter assertion: The counter value should decrement by 1 when counting down, and should not underflow.

```systemverilog
property p_down_counter_assertion;
    @(posedge clk) disable iff (!reset || load) (!up_down && !load && !reset) |-> (count == $past(count) - 1);
endproperty

a_down_counter_assertion: assert property (p_down_counter_assertion) else $error("Down counter assertion failed!");
```

Add these assertions to the interface or top module of the testbench:
interface loadable_up_down_counter_if(input wire clk);
    logic reset;
    logic load;
    logic up_down;
    logic [3:0] load_data;
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Add assertions here
    a_reset_assertion: ...
    a_load_assertion: ...
    a_up_counter_assertion: ...
    a_down_counter_assertion: ...
endinterface
