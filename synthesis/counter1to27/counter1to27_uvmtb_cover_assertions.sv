To design cover assertions for a UVM testbench of a counter that counts from 1 to 27, use the following SystemVerilog cover properties:

1. Cover when the counter reaches the minimum value (1):

```systemverilog
property min_value_cover;
  @(posedge clk) (reset !== 1'b1) |-> (counter == 1);
endproperty
covergroup min_value_cg;
  min_value_cover : cover property(min_value_cover);
endgroup
```

2. Cover when the counter reaches the maximum value (27):

```systemverilog
property max_value_cover;
  @(posedge clk) (reset !== 1'b1) |-> (counter == 27);
endproperty
covergroup max_value_cg;
  max_value_cover : cover property(max_value_cover);
endgroup
```

3. Cover when the counter transitions from maximum to minimum value (27 to 1):

```systemverilog
property max_to_min_cover;
  @(posedge clk) (reset !== 1'b1) |-> (counter == 27) ##1 (counter == 1);
endproperty
covergroup max_to_min_cg;
  max_to_min_cover : cover property(max_to_min_cover);
endgroup
```

4. Cover when the counter transitions from minimum to one more than the minimum value (1 to 2):

```systemverilog
property min_to_one_more_cover;
  @(posedge clk) (reset !== 1'b1) |-> (counter == 1) ##1 (counter == 2);
endproperty
covergroup min_to_one_more_cg;
  min_to_one_more_cover : cover property(min_to_one_more_cover);
endgroup
```

Instantiate these covergroups in the UVM testbench and sample them at appropriate times to ensure that all important scenarios are covered.
