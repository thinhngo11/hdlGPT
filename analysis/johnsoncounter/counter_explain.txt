GRADE: 9/10
analyze the following verilog for its functionality 
module JC #(parameter WIDTH=4) 
(
input clk;
input rstn;
output reg [WIDTH-1:0] out);

always @(posedge clk) begin)
  if (!rstn)
    out <= 1;
else begin
    out[WIDTH-1] <= ~out[0];
    for (int i=0; i < WIDTH-1; i=i+1) begin
        out[i] <= out[i+1];
    end
end
endmodule

The given Verilog code defines a module named "JC" with a parameter "WIDTH" (default 4). The module takes a clock signal "clk" 
and an active-low reset signal "rstn" as inputs, and outputs a vector "out" of size WIDTH.

The module implements a shift register with feedback, which can also be considered as a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) 
or a maximal-length pseudo-random sequence generator. Here's the functionality of the module:

1. On the rising edge of the clock signal "clk":

   a. If the reset signal "rstn" is low (active), set the output vector "out" to 1.
   b. If the reset signal "rstn" is high (inactive), perform the following operations:
      i. Set the most significant bit of "out" to the bitwise negation of the least significant bit of "out."
      ii. Shift the remaining bits of "out" to the right, effectively shifting the current values of "out[i+1]" to "out[i]."

In summary, this module generates a pseudo-random sequence of values in the "out" vector based on the clock signal "clk" and 
the active-low reset signal "rstn." When "rstn" is active, the module resets the output vector "out" to 1. When "rstn" is 
inactive, the module shifts the bits of the output vector "out" while applying a feedback mechanism based on the bitwise 
negation of the least significant bit. This can create a maximal-length sequence of WIDTH-bit values cycling through all 
non-zero values before repeating the sequence.

is the above verilog code a Johnson counter?
Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Upon re-evaluation, I realize that the given Verilog code does indeed 
describe a Johnson counter, also known as a twisted-ring counter, with a parameter "WIDTH" (default 4). The module takes 
a clock signal "clk" and an active-low reset signal "rstn" as inputs, and outputs a vector "out" of size WIDTH.

The functionality of the Johnson counter module is as follows:

1. On the rising edge of the clock signal "clk":
   a. If the reset signal "rstn" is low (active), set the output vector "out" to 1.
   b. If the reset signal "rstn" is high (inactive), perform the following operations:
      i. Set the most significant bit of "out" to the bitwise negation of the least significant bit of "out."
      ii. Shift the remaining bits of "out" to the right, effectively shifting the current values of "out[i+1]" to "out[i]."

A Johnson counter generates a repeating sequence of 2N states (where N is the number of flip-flops or the WIDTH parameter), 
cycling through every combination of 1s and 0s except for all 1s and all 0s. In this case, the given Verilog code describes 
a Johnson counter with the specified WIDTH.
