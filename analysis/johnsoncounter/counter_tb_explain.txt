GRADE: 10/10
analyze the following verilog code for its functionality associated with the above Johnson counter

module tb;
parameter WIDTH = 4;

reg clk;
reg rstn;
wire [WIDTH-1:0] out;

JC dut (.clk(clk), .rstn(rstn), .out(out));

always #10 clk = ~clk;

initial begin
  {clk, rstn} <= 0;

  $monitor ("T=%0t out=%b", $time, out);

  rstn <= 1;
  repeat (15) @(posedge clk);
  $finish;

endmodule

This is a testbench module for the Johnson counter you provided earlier. The testbench is designed to simulate and verify the 
functionality of the Johnson counter (JC) module. It includes the following components:

1. Parameters and signal declarations: The WIDTH parameter is set to 4, and the clk, rstn, and out signals are declared as reg 
or wire types, respectively.

2. Instantiation of the JC module: The Johnson counter module (JC) is instantiated and named as 'dut' (device under test). 
The clk, rstn, and out signals are connected to the corresponding signals in the JC module.

3. Clock generation: An always block generates a periodic clock signal with a 20-time unit period (10-time units high, 10-time 
units low).

4. Test sequence: The initial block runs a sequence to test the Johnson counter:
   - Initialize clk and rstn to 0.
   - Monitor the output 'out' and print its value, along with the simulation time, at each change.
   - Wait for 2 positive clock edges, keeping the reset (rstn) active (low).
   - Deassert the reset by setting rstn to 1.
   - Wait for 15 positive clock edges to observe the Johnson counter's behavior.
   - End the simulation with the $finish system task.

The testbench will simulate the JC module, apply the specified inputs, and print the output at each time step. This allows you 
to observe and verify the functionality of the Johnson counter under different conditions.
